## Comprehensive approach for static and dynamic Data Analytics using AutoML

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Internet of Things 
(IoT) data analytics face significant challenges in developing 
accurate and robust machine learning models. The CICIDS2017 
dataset, a common benchmark for IDS, suffers from issues like class 
imbalance, redundant data, and lack of preprocessing guidelines. 
Meanwhile, IoT systems generate massive, heterogeneous data 
streams susceptible to concept drift, degrading model performance 
over time. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) presents a 
promising solution by automating tasks like data preprocessing, 
feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and 
model updating. 

This project proposes a comprehensive AutoML approach 
to enhance intrusion detection and IoT analytics, leveraging cloud 
computing for scalable deployment. For CICIDS2017, automated 
techniques address dataset deficiencies, enabling robust IDS 
models. For IoT data, concept drift detection and automated model 
updating maintain accuracy on dynamic data streams. An end-to-end 
AutoML pipeline covering data preprocessing to model deployment 
is implemented for both static IDS and dynamic IoT tasks, utilizing 
cloud resources for efficient training and inference. Performance is 
rigorously evaluated, comparing AutoML models against traditional 
approaches. The feasibility of deploying AutoML in real-world 
security and IoT analytics applications is investigated, providing 
recommendations for effective utilization in cloud environments. 

By leveraging AutoML and cloud computing, this work 
aims to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of intrusion 
detection and IoT data analytics, reducing human effort while 
promoting adaptability to evolving threats and data distributions.
